## What is AG2

AG2 (formerly AutoGen) is an open-source programming framework for building AI agents and facilitating cooperation among multiple agents to solve tasks. AG2 aims to streamline the development and research of agentic AI, much like PyTorch does for Deep Learning. It offers features such as agents capable of interacting with each other, facilitates the use of various large language models (LLMs) and tool use support, autonomous and human-in-the-loop workflows, and multi-agent conversation patterns.

**Open Source Statement**: The project welcomes contributions from developers and organizations worldwide. Our goal is to foster a collaborative and inclusive community where diverse perspectives and expertise can drive innovation and enhance the project's capabilities. Whether you are an individual contributor or represent an organization, we invite you to join us in shaping the future of this project. Together, we can build something truly remarkable.

The project is currently maintained by a [dynamic group of volunteers](MAINTAINERS.md) from several organizations. Contact project administrators Chi Wang and Qingyun Wu via [support@ag2.ai](mailto:support@ag2.ai) if you are interested in becoming a maintainer.

## Roadmaps
-->

## Quickstart
The easiest way to start playing is
1. Click below to use the GitHub Codespace

    [![Open in GitHub Codespaces](https://github.com/codespaces/badge.svg)](https://codespaces.new/ag2ai/ag2?quickstart=1)

 2. Copy OAI_CONFIG_LIST_sample to ./notebook folder, name to OAI_CONFIG_LIST, and set the correct configuration.
 3. Start playing with the notebooks!

*NOTE*: OAI_CONFIG_LIST_sample lists gpt-4o as the default model. If you use a different model, you may need to revise various system prompts (especially if using weaker models like gpt-4o-mini). Proceed with caution when updating this default and be aware of additional risks related to alignment and safety.

## [Installation](https://ag2ai.github.io/ag2/docs/Installation)

### Option 1. Install and Run AG2 in Docker

Find detailed instructions for users [here](https://ag2ai.github.io/ag2/docs/installation/Docker#step-1-install-docker), and for developers [here](https://ag2ai.github.io/ag2/docs/Contribute#docker-for-development).

### Option 2. Install AG2 Locally

AG2 requires **Python version >= 3.8, < 3.13**. It can be installed from pip:

```bash
pip install ag2
```

Minimal dependencies are installed without extra options. You can install extra options based on the feature you need.

<!-- For example, use the following to install the dependencies needed by the [`blendsearch`](https://microsoft.github.io/FLAML/docs/Use-Cases/Tune-User-Defined-Function#blendsearch-economical-hyperparameter-optimization-with-blended-search-strategy) option.
```bash
pip install "autogen[blendsearch]"
``` -->

Find more options in [Installation](https://ag2ai.github.io/ag2/docs/Installation#option-2-install-autogen-locally-using-virtual-environment).

<!-- Each of the [`notebook examples`](https://github.com/ag2ai/ag2/tree/main/notebook) may require a specific option to be installed. -->

Even if you are installing and running AG2 locally outside of docker, the recommendation and default behavior of agents is to perform [code execution](https://ag2ai.github.io/ag2/docs/FAQ/#code-execution) in docker. Find more instructions and how to change the default behaviour [here](https://ag2ai.github.io/ag2/docs/Installation#code-execution-with-docker-(default)).

For LLM inference configurations, check the [FAQs](https://ag2ai.github.io/ag2/docs/FAQ#set-your-api-endpoints).

## Multi-Agent Conversation Framework

AG2 enables the next-gen LLM applications with a generic [multi-agent conversation](https://ag2ai.github.io/ag2/docs/Use-Cases/agent_chat) framework. It offers customizable and conversable agents that integrate LLMs, tools, and humans.
By automating chat among multiple capable agents, one can easily make them collectively perform tasks autonomously or with human feedback, including tasks that require using tools via code.

Features of this use case include:

- **Multi-agent conversations**: AG2 agents can communicate with each other to solve tasks. This allows for more complex and sophisticated applications than would be possible with a single LLM.
- **Customization**: AG2 agents can be customized to meet the specific needs of an application. This includes the ability to choose the LLMs to use, the types of human input to allow, and the tools to employ.
- **Human participation**: AG2 seamlessly allows human participation. This means that humans can provide input and feedback to the agents as needed.

For [example](https://github.com/ag2ai/ag2/blob/main/test/twoagent.py),

```python
from autogen import AssistantAgent, UserProxyAgent, config_list_from_json
# Load LLM inference endpoints from an env variable or a file
# See https://ag2ai.github.io/ag2/docs/FAQ#set-your-api-endpoints
# and OAI_CONFIG_LIST_sample
config_list = config_list_from_json(env_or_file="OAI_CONFIG_LIST")
# You can also set config_list directly as a list, for example, config_list = [{'model': 'gpt-4o', 'api_key': '<your OpenAI API key here>'},]
assistant = AssistantAgent("assistant", llm_config={"config_list": config_list})
user_proxy = UserProxyAgent("user_proxy", code_execution_config={"work_dir": "coding", "use_docker": False}) # IMPORTANT: set to True to run code in docker, recommended
user_proxy.initiate_chat(assistant, message="Plot a chart of NVDA and TESLA stock price change YTD.")
# This initiates an automated chat between the two agents to solve the task
```

This example can be run with

```python
python test/twoagent.py
```

After the repo is cloned.
The figure below shows an example conversation flow with AG2.

Alternatively, the [sample code](https://github.com/ag2ai/build-with-ag2/blob/main/samples/simple_chat.py) here allows a user to chat with an AG2 agent in ChatGPT style.
Please find more [code examples](https://ag2ai.github.io/ag2/docs/Examples#automated-multi-agent-chat) for this feature.

## Enhanced LLM Inferences

AG2 also helps maximize the utility out of the expensive LLMs such as gpt-4o. It offers [enhanced LLM inference](https://ag2ai.github.io/ag2/docs/Use-Cases/enhanced_inference#api-unification) with powerful functionalities like caching, error handling, multi-config inference and templating.

<!-- For example, you can optimize generations by LLM with your own tuning data, success metrics, and budgets.

```python
# perform tuning for openai<1
config, analysis = autogen.Completion.tune(
    data=tune_data,
    metric="success",
    mode="max",
    eval_func=eval_func,
    inference_budget=0.05,
    optimization_budget=3,
    num_samples=-1,
)
# perform inference for a test instance
response = autogen.Completion.create(context=test_instance, **config)
```

Please find more [code examples](https://ag2ai.github.io/ag2/docs/Examples#tune-gpt-models) for this feature. -->
